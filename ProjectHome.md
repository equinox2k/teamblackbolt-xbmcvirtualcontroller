XBMC Virtual Controller is a application written by EqUiNoX used to control XBMC as if you have a remote control using XBMC's event client.

You can use it to control XBMC on the same or different PC via your network.

The application also comes complete with a skinning engine (including a debug mode) and thus you can easilly create your own great looking original themed remotes.
